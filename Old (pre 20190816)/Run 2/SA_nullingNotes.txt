Notes for SA nulling:

potential difficulty with glasses

middle dial right pink left purple
if both on purple I have less flashing
two variables 

knob would be preferred for mathematical approach
difficulty with two dimensions - infinite possibilities

keep losing my spot



Conclusion: aborted
Sara was unhappy with:
 
lack of air /paint smell (this meant she was holding her breath and rushing - not ideal
two variables (difficult/infinite options)
lack of knobs on the dials

this coupled with considerably strong corrective glasses (which made questionable whether the observer would be able to perform the later stages of the experiment) led us to curtail the experiment with this observer.
