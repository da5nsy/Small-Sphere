---------------------

Pr650 white spray paint

Did 3 * each, in order painted (see photo of lined up cans)
Then 3 dark fields and 3 top white on Macbeth

All look pretty much the same, can't see fluorescence Vs lack of fluorescence but perhaps I need to be looking at reflectances rather than emittences. Will calibrate.

------------------


Visual impressions of spray paint

1 - Very fine matt finish, low specularity
Clear white

2 - yellow/green
Moderate specularity

3 - beige, moderate specularity

4 - white, strong specularity

5 - sleight beige, fairly low specularity

6 - slightly denser grain than 1, slightly off white, very low specularity

7 - unusual texture. Not appropriate. Low specularity though.

8 - essentially no texture and no specularity.

Contenders: 1, 5, 6, 8
1 and 8 are probably the stand-outs
