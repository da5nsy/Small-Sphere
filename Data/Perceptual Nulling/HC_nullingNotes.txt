HC notes

First impressions:
#2 makes more purple, brighter, pinky. Practically red.

started off on dial #1 at around 40 (accidentally), realised, pulled down to 27.0. HC found easier, but essentially started again.

For third HC reading, partcipant set dials #2/3 at bottom of range (started from scratch essentially)
