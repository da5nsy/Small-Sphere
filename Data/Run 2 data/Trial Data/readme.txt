I’m tired today. Last night was windy, and the boat was rocky, and I was worried about oversleeping my alarm to meet Laurence.
Laurence AU 2:

Specific Arduino file for each personal set up, well done past Danny

Set Ocean Optics going with room lights on (bare fiber- same as last time? Think so)

LW coming back 15 mins later

I have to work out if screen at right distance. 610mm - thank you keep and old Danny.

LW: Very good sleep, class until 9, in bed 1030/11, up at 7. Woke up slightly before alarm. Going drinking tonight.

Can get it more spot on at brighter, seems easier in some ways at lower luminances, [less flexibility at lower levels?]
I did the short version of the test immediately after (after faffing around trying to find the tripod for ~20mins), then tried to do the calibration run but realised I must’ve changed the pixel location for the quick big sphere thing I did before I went away, as I came back after half an hour and it was still going (I accidentally distrurbed it ~10 measurements from the end) – it had taken so long cos it was looking at black the whole time! I set it running properly, with the right pixel dimensions.
I think everything went OK today.
I left the OceanOptics running the whooole time, and had ~1minute in complete darkness before I turned it off.
Today we used the curtain, with one light on in the far section of the room, with Marcelo working on his computer (in the dark – bless him).
I stayed next to Laurence and we chatted. Will be sad to see him go (Friday).
Signed up Hannah to come back next Weds/Thurs 10-11.

I'm flagging again today, more sleep required.
Ran Laurence on the small sphere.
Started late, ~10 because my bus got stuck in traffic. We talked throughout. He was slightly hungover, but fine.

I messed up the screen characterization today (again) – it looks like the PR650 cable fell out of the laptop partway through. I ended up doing the characterisation much later in the afternoon (having done the shortened version of the test immediately after the LW RB trial).
LW again said it was a pleasant task.
Also, my laptop ran out of battery and so there’s a gap in the Ocean Optics data for a while (way after the actual experiment, but before the characterisation).

Working on HC_UA(2) this morning. 
955 setting everything up, no issues so far.
I'm going to have to leave at 1030 to meet John Mellario. Will show HC where the light switch is and tell her to leave everything as it is after, though I'll probably come back.
Started at 1003, sat on other side of curtain with Marcelo working and a light on in the far end of the room, but HC confirms that no light is penetrating the curtain.

HC finished at 1025, break neck speed! Hope everything is OK.
HC reported having had little sleep the night previous

(later noted: I don't appear to have a dark correction for this Ocean Optics recording)

We then had to pack up the hit so that I could run HC_RB(2) from 10:00. HC reported much better sleep, and was slightly slower than yesterday (which I’m happy about). I then immediately ran the 15trail calibration and the full screen calibration.
